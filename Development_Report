# Bug 1:
# Added "()" to the end of run_monolith. 
# Otherwise if this was not added, the system was full of defs but none was called upon.

# Bug 2:
# Added "=="
# Added "==" to opt == 1, this makes it a comparison compared to a assignment, allowing opt 1 to be a chosen element.

# Bug 3:
# Added "break"
# Added a "break" statement to prevent the infinite loop of loading and causing crashes.

# Bug 4:
# Removed plus sign
# Removed the plus sign in opt 4 to prevent the error of trying to add a string and an int together.

# Bug 5:
# Changed range 
# Changed the range in opt 1 to be the length of n, preventing out of range errors.

# Bug 6:
# Changed range
# Changed the range of opt 1 further to be Len(n), so that it doesnt break no matter the crew number.
